* **The Aether Dimension Unlocked!** Explore the breathtaking, heavenly realm of the Aether. Traverse floating islands, discover new mobs (like the adorable Moas!), and uncover ancient secrets in this iconic dimension. Get ready to embark on a whole new adventure!
* **Deeper and Darker Dimension:** Venture into a brand-new dimension that expands upon the Ancient Cities. Face terrifying new challenges and uncover unique rewards in the chilling depths. A compelling reason to brave the Deep Dark!
* **Cobblemon Gyms (CobGyms):** Test your skills! Basic Gym structures now spawn, providing dedicated arenas for Rising Champions Trainers to battle and prove their prowess.
* **Gotta Catch 'Em All Progress!** Many textures for mons included in previous versions are back! Combined with the ever-growing Pokédex in the quest book, we're even closer to being able to catch 'em all right here in Minecraft!
* **More Pokedollar Opportunities:** Many quests now offer Pokedollars, providing new avenues to earn currency!
* **Aether Enhancements:**

    * **Protect Your Moa:** Keep your feathered friends safe during your sky-high expeditions.
    * **Treasure Reforging:** Discover powerful, reforged treasures exclusive to the Aether.

## ⚙️ Changes & Fixes: A Polished Universe

This update is packed with over 100 updated mods and a constellation of fixes, all meticulously polished to provide the best possible experience.

* **Massive Mod Updates:** Over 100 mods have been updated to their latest and greatest versions, ensuring compatibility, stability, and access to the newest features.
* **Optimization Overhaul:** We've been hard at work under the hood! Enjoy a significantly smoother experience with:
    * Faster launch speeds – get into your world quicker!
    * Reduced item and JEI load times – no more waiting around.
    * Various rendering fixes – for a more visually pleasing and performant game.
* **World Generation Tweaks:**
    * **Structure Spacing:** Structures will now generate further apart, encouraging more exploration between points of interest (Leverages the new Structurify mod).
    * **Ore Rarity Adjustments (ATO):** Several cosmetic ores from All the Ores (ATO) have been made significantly rarer to enhance their value and uniqueness. This includes: Cinnabar, Ruby, Sapphire, Peridot, Fluorite, and Iridium.
    * *Note:* We may introduce more features and uses for these rarer resources in future updates!
* **Fancy Menu Enhancements:** The main menu has received a facelift:
    * Updated Main Menu icon – a fresh new look!
    * Temporary title splash text – a fun, dynamic welcome.
    * Bloomhost partnership integration – seamless server hosting.
    * Affiliate referral – support the modpack!

* **AllTheMons Data Pack:** ([Link](https://modrinth.com/datapack/allthemons))
    * We're temporarily using the "MegaShowdown" fork from their Discord as a base for "AllTheMons."
    * This brings back (most) textures from previous versions, so your favorite creatures look as they should.
    * A custom data/resource pack is still in development and will eventually replace this, but rest assured, this is perfectly safe to use in the meantime.
* **Tom's Simple Storage Refinements:** We've made some significant changes to Tom's Simple Storage for improved performance and stability:
    * TSS can now *only* connect to multi-block storage structures: Create's Vaults, Sophisticated Storage's storage controller, and Functional Storage Drawer Controllers.
    * This prevents accidental network loops and dramatically improves server performance, especially in complex setups.
    * All beacon functionality for TSS has been disabled. We recommend using Create's new logistics system for advanced item management.
* **Modified Exchange (Quest Shop) Updates:**
    * The Trainer Card is now available for purchase!
    * Various other fixes to improve the shop experience.
* **Farming for Blockhead Market Expansion:**
